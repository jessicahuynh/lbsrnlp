In general, if another object must be involved, that object is called ''the other object.'' A ''group of other objects'' and ''a different object'' also appear.

# Referential definitions

# Ambiguities
- TOUCH here is transitive while TOUCHING is intransitive.
- The first definition for SPIN is transitive while the second is intransitive.
- The first definition for LEAN is the causative while the second is intransitive.
- For CLOSE I gave only the definition that has the opposite meaning of OPEN, because it seems that CLOSE that has a similar meaning to NEAR could be subsumed under NEAR instead.

# Questions
- For some of the verbs, I am choosing not to consider, for example, bananas grasping things since they generally don't do that. Should I?
